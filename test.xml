		<title>Sample Project Title</title>
		<description>This project consisted of renovating a historic 3-story admissions building and construction of a new 2-story addition. The addition provides new offices on the lower level, along with a student, family, and alumni waiting area on the main level. The first floor plan was reconfigured creating a new main entrance portico with a direct path to the grand reception area. The construction schedule was compressed from the original 8 month duration to a 6 month period to open in time for the School's peak admission season; while remaining 11% under budget.Â </description>
